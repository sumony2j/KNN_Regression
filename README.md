# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression

## Introduction

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression is a non-parametric algorithm used for predicting continuous outcomes. It belongs to the family of instance-based learning methods, where predictions are made based on the similarity of new data points to the training data. This repository provides an overview of KNN regression along with examples and implementations in Python.

## How KNN Regression Works

In KNN regression, predictions are made by averaging the target values of the k nearest neighbors of the new data point. The distance metric used (e.g., Euclidean distance) determines the similarity between data points. KNN regression is simple to understand and implement, making it a popular choice for regression tasks.

### Example Scenario:

Suppose you want to predict the price of a house based on features such as square footage and number of bedrooms. Given a new house with unknown price, KNN regression would find the k nearest neighbors (houses) in the training data based on their features and average their prices to make the prediction.

## Key Parameters in KNN Regression

- **K**: The number of nearest neighbors to consider when making predictions. Choosing the appropriate value of K is crucial as it affects the bias-variance tradeoff of the model.
- **Distance Metric**: The metric used to compute the distance between data points, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or Minkowski distance.

## Datasets

This repository includes sample datasets in CSV format that can be used to practice KNN regression.
